# Hints and Tips :tada:

1. Using Moment.js is a lot like using Bootstrap or Jquery. By including them in your files you gain access to their methods. Much like how if you include Jquery you get access to jQuery() or \$()!

1. Read the acceptance criteria closely to ensure you understand what's required. Here's a breakdown in non-BDD wording:

   1. I want to be able to create a schedule for my day
   2. The current day should be displayed at the top of the calendar
   3. I can see the timeblocks for each day with those blocks colour coded for past, present and future.
   4. I can click a timeblock and enter an event for that timeblock
   5. The text for that event is saved in local storage
   6. Coming back to the page later on, the event is still saved in that timeblock.

1. So we have a list of different timeblocks for a day, and in each timeblock we can have an event.

1. Read the docs [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), be careful not to go down a rabbit hole of installing moment.js as an npm package, that's for much later on!
   > If you've got to the documentation and it's showing installs for different libraries like npm, and the only other option is download. You need to look for 'CDN' as that's where these packages can be pulled from such as: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/moment.js

# Submission Checklist :rocket:

1. Ensure that you submit both a link to your homework repo **and** your live github pages link.
   > Check for sneaky console errors!
2. Ensure what you've submitted works when you grade it yourself against the:

   - The user stories provided
   - The acceptance criteria's provided.

3. Make sure your homework repo has a quality README that _you_ have written, and provide screenshots **and a github pages** link!

4. Commit after most changes, all that code doesn't just appear first time :wink:

5. **Comment that JavaScript code :pray:**
